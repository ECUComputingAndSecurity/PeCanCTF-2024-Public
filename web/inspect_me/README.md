# Inspect Me

---

This is a beginner HTML inspector challenge. The flag is written in plain text within the comments of the HTML.

The participant is given a strong clue to inspect the page from everything on the front end of the web page. 
For participants that are unfamiliar with HTML, they can easily google how to inspect the source code.

Once the participant is inspecting the source, it becomes a matter of looking for the flag within the HTML.
I have used the comments to teach the participant a little about HTML, encouraging them to learn more.
This also has the benefit of helping hide the flag.

The flag can be found in a comment below the fourth item in the list.
