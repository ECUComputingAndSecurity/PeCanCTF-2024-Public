This is an intermediate web inspector challenge. The flag is written in plain text and distributed across the comments of the HTML, the CSS, and the Javascript files.

The participant is given the hint to inspect the code from the theme of the challenge, the website refers to Inspector Gadget.
I have built three web pages so that the participant has to cover more ground before finding the flag components.
If the participant is unfamiliar with inspecting code, they can find out more by googling web inspection challenges.

The first section of the flag can be found in a comment in the HTML of the about (History) page.
The second section of the flag can be found in the external CSS file, which is displayed on every page.
The final section of the flag can be found in the external javascript file which is only found on the gadgets page.
