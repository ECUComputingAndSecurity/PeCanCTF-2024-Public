  We are on the trail of a gang of cyber criminals. One of the gang members was overheard talking about a message in which the gang leader congratulated his gang for some successes, but also told his gang members to stop leaving the operations area messy.

  The gang member mentioned the word 'pizza' specifically. The gang member was also overheard mentioning something about a flag towards the end of a message. We have obtained a complete copy of the message. Our experts have taken a look at the message, and provided an analysis to help you decipher it.
