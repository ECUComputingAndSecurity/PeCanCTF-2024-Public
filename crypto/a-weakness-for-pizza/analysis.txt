The gang is using a homophonic cipher that randomly assigns numbers between 0 and 199 to English letters. Assuming that common letters are assigned to more numbers than uncommon letters (in accordance with a standard distribution of English letter frequencies), our experts have guessed at this arrangement: 'e':25, 't':19, 'a':16, 'o':15, 'i':14, 's':12, 'n':13, 'r':12, 'h':12, 'd':8, 'l':8, 'u':6, 'c':6, 'm':5, 'y':4, 'f':4, 'w':4, 'g':4, 'p':4, 'b':2, 'v':2, 'k':1, 'x':1, 'j':1, 'q':1, 'z':1
In other words, in the message, there are 25 different numbers that represent 'e' but only one number standing in for 'z'.
For example, if we managed to work out that the number 001 represented 'e', it would represent 'e' everywhere it appears in the message. But there's still a lot of work to do just to identify all the letters 'e', because there are 24 other numbers that represent 'e'. This is why this type of cipher is much more secure than a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.
The gang members have left spaces between the words - a mistake that gives us a chance of deciphering the whole message. Using what you know about English, try to decipher the whole message.
