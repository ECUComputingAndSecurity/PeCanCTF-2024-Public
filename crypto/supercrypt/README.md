The user is supplied with `cipher.txt` and `supercrypt.py`.

Advanced competitors may see the last 32 characters of `cipher.txt` resemble a hash value, which they can plug into Google or a table to reverse it to a value of `123456`. (This is the key).

Most competitors may resort to looking at the Python script code and complete some basic reverse-engineering to see what may give them clues to finding the flag.

Competitors should spot that an MD5 hash of the key used is being appended to the ciphertext. They should similarly spot that ciphertext generated by the stream cipher is prefixed with `s:` whilst the ROT13 cipher is prefixed with `r:`.

The ciphertext also does not look anything like what can be produced by ROT13, a further suggestion that the stream cipher was used.

So, using the key from the hash, the competitor should load the Python script, select the stream cipher tool, select the decryption tool, use the key of `123456` on `cipher.txt` as the input file and any file name of their choice as the output, to have the file contain the flag of `pecan{w15h-y0u-g00d-luck-cr4ck1ng-0th3r-fl4gs!}`.
