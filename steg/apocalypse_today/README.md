# Apocalypse Today

---

This is a steganography challenge, where the flag is placed in plain text at the end of the file. 

The flag has been appended to the end of the file, outside the original bounds, making it easier to detect.
The participant is given the hint within the image, that the end is near, loosely referring them to view the bytes at the end of the file.

The participant can solve this challenge by using steganography tools such as stegsolve.
The flag is also very visible if they use 'cat' or 'strings' on the file.
