# The Pecan+ Hero

---

The core challenge is to find and decipher the flag which is encrypted with a 7 shift caesar cypher (ROT-(minus)7).

I have used chatGPT to write a short story about a group of students competing in Pecan+.
I stored the encrypted flag next to the only instance of the word brilliant in the story.
The description mentions the word 'brilliant' repeatedly to hint that you should find that word in the story.
The participant can do so visually by reading the story or using search tools.
The flag should be very obvious once located.

Once the participant has the flag, it becomes a case of identifying what the encryption is and how many shifts it has been rotated by.
This can be achieved by simple trial and error or a simple script that outputs the result of all shifts.
