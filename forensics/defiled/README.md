Clues are 'deFILEd' (file command) and 'enchanted digits' (magic numbers)

Using the `file` command reveals that despite its extension, the file is not a png.
Referencing the list of magic numbers on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures), participants should locate the correct file signature for PNG files (`89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`).
Download and install a hex editor (e.g., `hexedit`) to manipulate the file's hexadecimal content.
Open the file in the hex editor and replace the initial bytes with the correct PNG magic numbers (`89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`).
Once the magic numbers are restored, the flag will be revealed in plain text within the image file.
