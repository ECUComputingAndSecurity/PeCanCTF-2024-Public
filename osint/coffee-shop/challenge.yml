  I went to this coffee shop with my childhood friend earlier this year and it was really good!
  However, I have no idea who founded the coffee shop..., but most importantly, I had this pour over coffee that had floral, tangerine and white tea tasting notes, and it became available in London somewhere in the first half of 2023 and I can't seem to remember the item name, how it's processed, or the origin of this specific roast. Maybe there is some way to find out?
