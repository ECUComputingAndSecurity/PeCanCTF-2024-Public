  Follow the flow. Know the origin.
  What you are looking for was accidentally swallowed by a creature at the location where this photo was captured. When it realised what it had in its stomach, it escaped to the closest CITY as seen in the photo.
  Upon arriving at the city, it continued through the river until reaching the river's source. Once you arrive there, the creature will show you a sign written like pecan{TheRiver'sNameByTheWurundjeriPeople_PostCodeOfTheRiverSource}.
