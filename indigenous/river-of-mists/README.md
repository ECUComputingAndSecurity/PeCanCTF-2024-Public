The player should look at those signs in the photo, and should see that MELBOURNE (2723km) is closest city based on the sign.
The iconic river is Yarra River, which is known as Birrarung, its original name by the Wurundjeri people.
Its source is Mt Baw Baw, having post code 3833.

This challenge is intended for players to read the signs, know which one is the closest destination, get to know a significant thing of a city and its Aboriginal story and meaning (as hinted by the challenge title, flag, hint, and description), follow the origin of something, know one way to find a location based on postcode.
