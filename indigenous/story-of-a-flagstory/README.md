* The cities in the images are as follows:
  * City 1: Hobart, Tasmania
  * City 2: Perth, WA
  * City 3: Sydney, NSW
* Of these cities, Sydney has its airport almost directly south of its CBD. This can be apparent in the images themselves (by the runways), or by querying an external map.
* After that, players can use Google Maps to search for Indigenous conservation sites located around Sydney. Particularly, there is one (<https://maps.app.goo.gl/jDduA9vmBt4CGL4c9>) just about 20km north of the CBD.
* Among the user-uploaded photos for this location, there will be several engravings of emus.
* Players may then search for "Star Stories of the Dreaming"; there are then many attestations of the "emu in the sky". Notably, this is the first result on Google: <http://www.aboriginalastronomy.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Star-Stories-of-the-Dreaming-Guide.pdf>
