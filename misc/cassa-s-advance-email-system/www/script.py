--Final chalenege to get the flag--
p.s if you cant do this part without first finding money.py!

Your challenge is too write a script that calculates how much money Patrick makes.

Patrick outputs 1 for every $5 he makes and outputs 0 for every $5 he losses.
Patricks ouputs are stored in a list inside of money.py (e.g money = [1,1,0,1]) so in this case he has made $10 over all.


The flag for this challenge is the amount of money the Patrick has made in digits. e.g pecan{100}, pecan{-50}
