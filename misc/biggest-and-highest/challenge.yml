  The flag is posted at the highest Location in the biggest state of Australia. "mount ???????" is written in a philosophical way. To understand that written style, you need to go through the door by using the First Nations Name of The Capital City of that state as a case-sensitive key. Learn from the philosophy, and apply it. Rest assured, you'll get the flag, all in lower case. Flag format: pecan{word1_word2}
