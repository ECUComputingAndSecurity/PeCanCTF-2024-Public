The coin has a morse code sequence that represents 'three'.

The central block of letters is a rail-fence cipher, using 'three' rails. This decodes (use cyberchef) to 'divide by leagues under the sea, north west, they are the key'.

If you take the numbers at the top and divide by 20,000 you get '51.8995, 2.1244'.

If you take the coordinates (noting it is NW not NE - ie -2.1244) and look using google earth, you will find it is 'GCHQ'.

The outer ring of letters is a vignere cipher, use cyberchef and the key (GCHQ) you will get 'pecanplus ecusri org challenges coin-2023 gchq'.

The pigpen cipher at the bottom translates to 'url'. Turn the above to a URL: <https://pecanplus.ecusri.org/challenges/coin-2023/gchq> and you will get the flag.
